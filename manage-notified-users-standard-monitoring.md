# Managing notified users for standard monitoring

Notified users for the standard monitoring service receive automated notifications any time a device does not respond to a ping in the allotted response time. You can add or remove notified users at any time, and notified users must be on the account that is associated with the device to receive a notification. Follow these steps to manage notified users for the standard monitoring service.

1. From the **Monitoring** screen, click **Monitor Status** in the **Basic** column to view the **Monitors** screen for the device.
3. Click the **Expand** icon next to **Manage Notified users** to expand the section.
4. Determine whether a **Managed User** should be added or removed.

## Next steps

If a notified user was added with these steps, the user is notified in the event of a missed ping response. If a notified user was removed, the user no longer receives a notification regarding a missed ping response that is associated with the device.
